### Background

The idea for the project came from simply calculating fuel efficieny with a prediction algorithm.  The choice in data set was random.

### Sources

The dataset was derived from the Auto Dataset in the ISLR Package found [here](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ISLR/index.html)

### Developement Process

I simply took the first 6 columns of the dataset which included the mpg, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, and acceleration.  From that subset I fitted a randomforest algorithm.  The positions of the sliders will have 5 new variables for the fitted model to predict.

### To Use

Simply wait the first time for about a minute.  At this time the app is creating the fitted model.  After that, simply adjust the sliders to the desired values and the app will automatically try and predict the MPG efficiency.
